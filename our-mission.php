							 <h3>Dedicated to each trainee’s success as a professional truck driver, AIT’s staff encourage growth beyond the basics.</h3>
							<p><img src="/migration/Our-Mission.jpg" align="left" class="content-picture" alt="mission cdl training and truck driving school">AIT’s truck driving schools are focused on helping trainees attain their Commercial Driver’s License and preparing them for jobs immediately after graduation. AIT is a private technical/career institute geared towards preparing truck driving school trainees for careers in the trucking industry. Although a portion of the classes are held in a classroom setting, the learning experience trainees receive at AIT is far from rote memorization and theoretical knowledge. AIT’s truck school is dedicated to helping students get hands-on training and the development of real-world skills that translate directly into solid careers.</p> 
							<p><i><b>“American Institute of Trucking is dedicated to providing training that will enable trainees to learn and develop the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in the trucking industry. AIT’s goal is not simply to train individuals to pass the Commercial Drivers License test, but to produce graduates who will be valued employees at some of the finest transportation companies in America.”</b></i></p>
