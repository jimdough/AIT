<h1>How to Get Your CDL License in Colorado</h1>
<p>Looking for CDL training in the Denver, Colorado area? AIT Truck Driver Training offers comprehensive courses at our <a href="../../denver-colorado.php" target="_blank">Denver campus</a> to prepare you for a successful career in truck driving! AIT courses go beyond basic CDL training to prepare you for a long-term career in addition to teaching you the skills needed to pass your CDL exam.</p>
<h3>Why You Need a CDL</h3>
<p>The <a href="../../blog/what-is-cdl-training/" target="_blank">Commercial Drivers License (CDL)</a> verifies a truck driver’s skill and knowledge to drive a truck safely on the highway. Before the Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986, anybody with a license could drive tractor-trailers on major roads. By requiring training and a proven amount of skill from truck drivers, we can keep our highways safer for all drivers! </p>
<p>CDLs differ based on the size and weight of the truck you’ll be driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (<a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration/commercial-drivers-license/drivers" target="_blank">FMSCA</a>) defines the Class A and Class B CDLs (the required licenses of truck drivers) as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class A CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.</span></li>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class B CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll need to pass the Colorado CDL exam in order to be eligible to earn your CDL. The CDL exam will include both knowledge and skill-based testing. You’ll be required to answer trucking questions as well as prove your driving techniques to a prompter.</p>
<h3>CDL Requirements in Colorado</h3>
<p>First, make sure that you meet all Colorado CDL requirements and can show proof of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Required Age</strong> – You have to be at least 21 years old to drive a tractor-trailer interstate (between states). If you are between 18-20, you can earn a restricted CDL that allows for truck driving in the same state (intrastate driving). You will need to verify your age with an accepted form of identification, usually an active driver’s license.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social Security Number</strong> – In addition to photo or standard identification, you will need to provide proof of a Social Security number. Social Security numbers can be found on official documents like a Social Security card, W-2, 1099, or payroll stub. All documents must be originals, not copies.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof of Residency</strong> – In order to be eligible to earn a CDL in Colorado, you will need to prove that you are a resident of the state. You will be asked to provide two forms of proof of your permanent Colorado address.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passed CDL Exam </strong>– The CDL exam is a combination of hands-on driving and knowledge-based testing, so it’s important to come to the test prepared! Also, you will need to be able to pass a five-stage drug test to ensure safe driving regardless of state standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems like a lot to think about, don’t fret! AIT’s industry-expert instructors help trainees through the whole process and are great resources for industry advice.</p>

<h3>How do I get my CDL Permit in Colorado?</h3>

After graduating from AIT Truck Driver Trainer and passing your exam, you can trade in your permit for an actual Commercial Driver’s License!</p>
