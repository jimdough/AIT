<h1>How to Get Your CDL License in Nevada</h1>
<p>If you’re looking to earn your Class A CDL in Nevada, then AIT Truck Driver Training is the right way to go! At our <a href="../../las-vegas-nevada.php" target="_blank">campus in Las Vegas</a>, AIT’s industry-expert instructors will teach you the critical skills required of professional CDL truck drivers.</p>
<h3>What is a CDL?</h3>
<p>What is a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) and why do you need it to be a truck driver? In short, the CDL is a certification that allows you to drive large machinery such as tractor-trailers on the nation’s highways.</p>
<p>Types of CDLs vary depending on the total weight of the vehicle you’ll be driving. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (<a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/" target="_blank">FMSCA</a>) defines Class A and Class B CDL licenses as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class A CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds.</span></li>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class B CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986 requires all CDL drivers to take a state exam demonstrating their competency on the road with heavy machinery. The CDL is all about keeping the roads safe for everyone!</p>
<h3>Class A CDL Nevada Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Age</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – According to the national standard, truck drivers who transport materials between states (interstate driving) must be at least 21 years old. Drivers between the ages of 18-20 are allowed to obtain a CDL but are restricted to driving within the same state (intrastate driving). You’ll need to bring a form of identity to verify you’re the proper age for the specific license you’re applying for.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Residency</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – In order to earn a CDL in Nevada, you will have to prove that you are a resident of the state. You will be asked to bring an original document (not a copy, as copies will not be accepted) that states your permanent street address in Nevada.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Physical</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – CDL truck drivers need to be in a healthy condition to drive, and are asked to prove up-to-date medical visits. A physical exam may be required if you haven’t had a medical examination within the last few years. Check with an <a href="../../contact-ait-trucking-school.php" target="_blank">AIT representative</a> or your local Nevada DMV to verify if a physical exam will be required.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">CDL Exam</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Whether or not you earn your CDL is ultimately up to whether or not you pass the CDL exam. This is why it is so important to come prepared with comprehensive truck driver training from an accredited school. That’s where AIT Truck Driver Training comes in!</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I get my CDL permit in Nevada?</h3>
<p>Just like you had to get a driver’s permit before you could earn your license, you’ll need to get a CDL permit first. The CDL permit allows you to drive a tractor-trailer in training scenarios. You won’t need a CDL permit before coming to AIT Truck Driver Training, though. Shortly after arriving, AIT trainers will guide you through the process of getting one.</p>
<h3>How do I get my CDL in Nevada?</h3>
<p>You are required to take the CDL exam in order to earn your CDL license. And chances are, you probably don’t prefer to take it a second time. It’s very important, then, that you come prepared the first time around with comprehensive truck driver training!</p>
<p>At AIT, trainees not only get the skills and knowledge needed to pass the Nevada state CDL exam but also the principles and practices for success as truck drivers. Right now truck drivers are in <a href="../../blog/driver-shortage-means-opportunities/" target="_blank">high demand</a> and have the opportunity to take part in incredible industry perks* like</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Job security </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Paid vacation </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Health, dental, and vision insurance </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">401k retirement plans</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Life insurance</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Rider and pet policies and more!</span></li>
