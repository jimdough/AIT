				  <h1>Trucking school in Las Vegas, Nevada</h1>
				  
				  <p>Trucking school teaches the essential skills needed to pass the CDL exam. AIT Truck Driver Training goes well beyond the basics and prepares our graduates for life on the road as professional truck drivers for major transportation carriers! All trucking schools train for this CDL exam, but equally important is the preparation needed for life on the road to become an outstanding Professional Truck Driver and not all CDL classes include this valuable information.</p>

<p>CDL classes at AIT’s trucking school in Las Vegas, Nevada, prepare students for their careers as a Professional Truck Driver. AIT's experienced instructors teach students the proper techniques for driving tractor trailers, tracking miles and time through log management, coupling trailers, and performing pre- and post-trip inspections. In addition, AIT's comprehensive career training is focused on encouraging growth well beyond the basics.</p>

<p>Through AIT’s comprehensive trucking school, hands-on training and its incredible team of instructors, you can complete CDL training in as little as four weeks! AIT’s training programs, job placement assistance, and carrier opportunities will have you on the path to becoming a Professional Truck Driver in no time!</p>

				  
  <h3>Why are Professional Truck Drivers in such high demand?</h3>
 
<p>After a pitfall in the economy, America is finally turning around its production game. More goods produced means more distribution, and transporting these goods isn’t a task that can be outsourced. This is great news for anyone looking for a fresh beginning in an exciting career! By earning your Class A Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), you make the first step towards entering this quickly expanding job market.</p>

<h3>Professional Truck Driving is a role fit for anyone with a clean driving record, a Class A CDL, and a will to succeed!</h3>
 
<p>The Professional Truck Driving Industry, already a market with competitive positions, is about to face a rising peak in demand throughout the next ten years. American Trucking Associations (ATA) figures an additional 89,000 drivers a year are needed to support America’s steadily growing economy in the next decade. Due to things like the replacement of retiring truck drivers and industry growth, the Professional Truck Driving Industry is in need of qualified drivers that will help nurture America’s growing economy. </p>
