							 <hr />
							<p>The Diesel Truck Driver course begins with a thorough introduction to long-haul driving and the history of trucking and moves into an in-depth study that goes far beyond the basics needed for the CDL test. AITâ€™s dedicated instructors bring their industry experience into the classroom and practical skills modules and infuse the carefully structured curriculum with their insights. Topics covered include DOT regulations, vehicle & control systems, equipment maintenance, CPR & First Aid, extreme driving techniques, impact on family life, and work & personal financial management. Road & range practice, using modern equipment found in carrier fleets, offers trainees the opportunity to cover safe, efficient driving techniques and develop proficiency.
