<h1>Truck Driver Shortage - The US Needs CDL Drivers</h1>
</div>
<hr>
<p><img class="content-picture" src="migration/The-Need.jpg" alt="truck driver shortage cdl training" align="left"> Carriers across the country are actively seeking CDL truck drivers and will continue to do so into the coming years. As it stands, there is a shortage of qualified, reliable truck drivers and the demand for them is steadily increasing. It is estimated that more than 300,000 positions need to be filled in the coming years to keep up with supply demand and truck driver shortage across the country<span class="asterisk">*</span>.</p>
<p><b>To meet the growing demand for truck drivers, the transportation industry leaders are forming partnerships focused on training, growth, and safety by endorsing programs like AIT to train this new generation of truck drivers.</b></p>
<p>Carriers actively seek AIT-trained graduates to fill their fleets — they know AIT graduates are safe, reliable, and knowledgeable CDL drivers looking for secure careers. The industry encourages those with a high school diploma or GED, tech or college graduates, military personnel in transition, and veterans to consider truck driving to meet the demands of the US economy.</p>
<p class="disclaimer">** The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects trucking to add 330,100 jobs between 2010 and 2020. “Tons of trucking jobs …” CNN Money, July 24, 2012</p>
