							 <h4>"If you bought it, a truck brought it.”</h4>
							<p><img src="/migration/Industry-Info.jpg" align="left" class="content-picture" alt="CDL truck driving" >The trucking industry hauls billions of tons in freight through towns, cities, and across the country every year and employs millions of people. In addition to providing employment, trucking is essential to the US economy — every business depends on it. Throughout the various stages of production and distribution; supplies, raw materials, and goods need to be moved between warehouses, manufacturers, and retailers. Over 80% of the nation’s communities rely on this system to maintain reliable access to food, clothing, medical supplies, and consumer goods.</p> 
							
							<p>The industry is overseen by the US Department of Transportation which sets regulations for safety and monitors compliance. Drivers are protected by rules governing licensing, hours of service, and carrier compliance. In addition to DOT regulations, trucking has become safer over the years because of improved equipment, innovative technologies, and more extensive training. Satellite communications, cell phones, GPS navigation, and tracking systems are all put to use on long hauls and in local routes alike.</p>
