							<h3>Military Programs for Veteran Truck Driver Training</h3>
							 <hr />
							<p>AIT thanks active duty, reserve, veteran and retired military personnel for their dedicated service to the nation. Accordingly, AIT directs interested applicants to the Federal programs available for military personnel to advance their education through truck driving school. Experience gained through military service may reduce the time and cost of certain portions of truck driver training programs. AIT – Phoenix is approved to offer Veterans Educational Assistance Program Benefits to Qualified Veterans</p>
							
							
							<p>Please contact an Advisor in AIT’s Financial Aid Department for more information on the aid options available to military personnel in transition, reservists, and veterans and for eligibility requirements.</p>
