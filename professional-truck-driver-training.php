							 <hr />
							<p>AIT’s Professional Truck Driver course begins with the history of the trucking industry and an in-depth introduction to long-haul driving, progressively building a strong knowledge and skill base that goes far beyond the basics needed for the CDL test. AIT’s industry-experienced instructors bring a realistic, objective wealth of information into the classroom and practical skills modules and infuse the carefully structured curriculum with their insights. Topics covered include DOT regulations, vehicle & control systems, equipment maintenance, CPR & First Aid, extreme driving techniques, impact on family life, and work & personal financial management. Road & range practice, using modern equipment found in carrier fleets, offers trainees the opportunity to cover safe, efficient driving techniques and develop proficiency. Once on-site training is complete, trainees transfer into a valuable externship with one of AIT’s preferred carriers for essential on-the-job training.</p> 
							<p>Successful completion of this program qualifies a graduate to work in a wide range of positions, including non-supervised solo driving.</p>
