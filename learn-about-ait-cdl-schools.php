							 <h3>AIT-trained professional truck drivers are prepared for more than life on the road.</h3>
							 
							<p>American Institute of Trucking (AIT) is an accredited private career institute dedicated to training drivers for careers in the trucking industry. With multiple campuses in the Southwest, an industry-experienced staff, and a 21 year history of promoting top quality CDL drivers, AIT has trained and placed more than 10,000 drivers with well-known carriers.</p>
