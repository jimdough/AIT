<p class="title" style="left: 0px;"><a href="#">How much money can I make as a truck driver?</a></p>
<div class="content">
<p>Pay and benefits are important issues when considering a new career. Pay scales vary among carriers, of course, but it is reasonable to project that a rookie driver in the first year can earn $40,900<span class="asterisk">*</span> and that’s not including the generous benefits many employing carriers offer. Benefits also vary among carriers, but many offer health &amp; dental insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, wellness programs, and even stock options.</p>

<p class="title" style="left: 0px;"><a href="#">Are there jobs in trucking in a slow economy?</a></p>
<div class="content">
<p>Absolutely! Even in a sluggish economy or in a recession, truck drivers are essential to every major industry. Every point in production -- from acquiring raw materials, to manufacturing, and on to storage or ultimate delivery of goods -- relies on dependable, regular deliveries. There’s a saying in the industry that rings true, no matter the state of the economy -- "If you bought it, a truck brought it."</p>

<p class="title" style="left: 0px;"><a href="#">What kind of jobs can I find in the industry?</a></p>
<div class="content">
<p>A variety of trucking jobs can be found industry-wide. There are long haul or over the road (OTR) drivers covering long distance routes. LTL drivers, or less than truckload, pick up varying smaller sized loads that ship like full truckloads, but end up delivered much like parcels. There are also countless local route drivers who do a lot of city driving. There is also plenty of room for advancement within the industry -- recruiters, dispatchers, trainers, and even safety &amp; compliance officers start out as drivers to gain valuable experience.</p>
