<h1>How to Get Your CDL License in Arizona</h1>
<p>Interested in getting your CDL license in Arizona?  AIT's local truck driving school in Phoenix, Arizona is just the place to jumpstart your career in the trucking industry! With over 20 years of service, AIT maintains a coveted A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau and has trained thousands of Professional Truck Drivers.</p>
<h3>Why You Need a CDL</h3>
<p>Before the Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) existed, any person could drive a tractor-trailer with a regular driver’s licenses. The Commercial Motor Vehicle Act of 1986 changed that. Now truck drivers are required to take a state exam that proves their skill and knowledge on the road.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a> (FMSCA) defines the Class A and Class B CDLs (the licenses of professional truck drivers) as: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class A CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any combination of vehicles with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 26,001 or more pounds provided the GVWR of the vehicle(s) being towed is in excess of 10,000 pounds. </span></li>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Class B CDL</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Any single vehicle with a GVWR of 26,001 or more pounds, or any such vehicle towing a vehicle not in excess of 10,000 pounds GVWR. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>If a career in CDL truck driving is in your future, you’ll need a Class A CDL and comprehensive training. AIT is just the place! While earning your Class A CDL with AIT, industry professionals work with you in the classroom and behind the wheel to make sure you are well prepared for a successful career!</p>
<h3>CDL Requirements in Arizona</h3>
<p>Start by making sure you currently meet all state requirements and can provide proof:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Authorized Presence</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;"> – Due to Arizona law and FMCSA regulations, those looking to attend truck driving school in Arizona will need to show proof that their presence is authorized under federal law. The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) provides </span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;" href="https://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/96-0526.pdf?sfvrsn=4" target="_blank">a list of acceptable documents of proof</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Identification and Proof of Age</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;"> – All applicants for original driver licenses or identification cards in Arizona are required to provide </span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;" href="https://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/96-0155.pdf?sfvrsn=16" target="_blank">two forms</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;"> of identification. “One form must have your photo, or you must present three forms of identification if no photo identification is available,” according to ADOT. All of your forms of identification must be originals, and copies will not be accepted.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Social Security Number Verification</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;"> – Proof of a Social Security number is required in order to receive your CDL. As with other proofs of identification, your evidence of SSN must be an original and cannot be a copy.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">State of Domicile</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;"> – You will need to verify that you are a resident of Arizona in order to apply for CDL training or a CDL in the state. According to ADOT, “The state of domicile is defined as the state of your true, fixed and permanent home and principal residence; it must be where you intend to return after being away.”</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6;">Pass the state test</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6;"> – Because the test will determine if you hold a CDL in Arizona or not, you should come prepared! The exam is a mixture of hands-on driving and knowledge-based testing, and will cover things like pre-trip inspections, merging into traffic, and road sign comprehension.</span></li>
</ul>
