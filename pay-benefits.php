							<p>As with most careers, there are important questions to answer about pay and benefits. In the trucking industry, pay is usually based on mileage. Proven safety, timely delivery, and dependability all boost that base figure when employers evaluate their drivers. A conscientious driver can earn $40,900<span class="asterisk">*</span> in just the first year on the road.</p> 
						
							<p>AIT-trained truck drivers become valued assets to their employing carrier companies. Carriers choose to invest in their employees by offering sought-after benefits such as health & dental insurance, competitive salaries, tuition reimbursement terms, retirement plans, stock purchase options, paid time off, and wellness programs. In short, carriers are looking for safe, dependable truck drivers and AIT training prepares those drivers for long-term, secure careers.</p>
