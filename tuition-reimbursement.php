							<p>AIT assists applicants in securing financing, if needed, and a pre-hire agreement with one of our preferred carriers. Many carriers offer generous tuition reimbursement programs as a benefit to their drivers — some even offer 100% reimbursement of approved costs incurred during training in truck driving school. The details of these programs do vary by carrier, but most involve working for a specified period of time, maintaining a reasonable GPA in classes, and approval before training begins. Arranging for tuition reimbursement as part of the pre-hire agreement benefits both carrier and driver — the carrier can rely on a well-qualified driver and the driver has assistance with paying loans or out-of-pocket training expenses while securing a successful career.</p>
