The AIT Truck Driver program is designed to provide a basic, solid, knowledge of over-the-road driving and practical behind-the-wheel skill training. Each course module is specifically structured to develop the skills required to attain a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL). AIT’s qualified instructors spend class time reinforcing information on DOT regulations, trip planning and equipment inspections, cargo handling, defensive driving techniques, and a host of topics essential for today’s truck drivers. Road &amp; range practice with experienced instructors and carefully limited groups provides ample opportunity to cover safe, efficient driving techniques and develop proficiency.
